## Requirements and implementation
### HTML
- [x] _Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content._ (5/5)

Semantic tags are used throughout the website. Couple of divs here and there to make containers and such.

### CSS
- [x] _Styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience._ (5/5)

I used Bootstrap 5 to style the website with additional animations for page loads and such. The site is responsive and scales very nicely. I used flexboxes and grids frequently for example in the "Search" page when loading in cocktails.

### Javascript Basics
- [x] Advanced logic, looping through data, and dynamic DOM updates. (4/5)

I tried to use OOP principles by refactoring functions etc. in to their own classes but in my opinion, it isn't quite what was required. Data looping and dynamic DOM updates can be seen in CocktailUI class, where data is getting looped through to extract ingredients and measurements, and then displayed on the screen.

### Asynchronous Operations
- [x] Error handling is implemented (for failed API calls, etc.). (4/5)

Error handling can be found in the ErrorHandler class and it's functions. Alert cards are shown when an error occurs.
