## Requirements and implementation
### HTML
- [x] _Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content._ (5/5)

Semantic tags are used throughout the website e.g in Navbar and footer and the main content of the webpage. Also added metadata to make the site more SEO friendly. Couple of divs are here and there to make containers and such.

### CSS
- [x] _Styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience._ (5/5)

I used Bootstrap 5 to style the website with additional animations for page loads and such. The site is responsive and scales very nicely. I used flexboxes and grids frequently for example in the "Search" page when loading in cocktails.

### Javascript Basics
- [x] Consistent use of Object-Oriented JavaScript principles. (5/5)

I refactored all the functions to their own classes as static methods that can be called when needed. This makes the code able to scale well if needed and improves the readability of the code. All the classes and their methods are commented and there's some more commenting on different methods explaining what they do.

### Asynchronous Operations
- [x] Error handling is implemented (for failed API calls, etc.). (4/5)

Error handling can be found in the ErrorHandler class and it's functions. Alert cards are shown when an error occurs.
